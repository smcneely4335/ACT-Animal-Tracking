# we haven't told Actel anything about which arrays connect to which
# so it's not able to properly determine which movements are valid/invalid

n  # don't save a copy of the results to a RData object... this time.

# Review the output .html file that has popped up in a browser.
# Our analysis might not make a lot of sense, since...
# actel assumed our study area was linear, we didn't tell it otherwise!
