# Create a bubble plot of the area on which we zoomed in earlier. Set the bounding box using the provided nw + se cordinates, change the colour scale and
# resize the points to be smaller. As a bonus, add points for the other receivers that don't have any detections.
# Hint: ?detection_bubble_plot will help a lot
# Here's some code to get you started
